# 🚀 My Web Development Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository is a curated list of my personal and practice projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**. These projects were created as part of my learning journey, referencing open-source resources and tutorials to explore core frontend concepts like DOM manipulation, state management, interactive UI components, and modern tooling with React + Vite.

## ⚙️ JavaScript Projects

- **🎬 [Custom Video Player](https://github.com/rakshasubramanya08/video_play)**  
  Built a fully functional and responsive video player with custom controls like play/pause, volume, seek bar, and skip functions. Designed to replicate real-world media player behavior using native browser APIs and DOM manipulation, with a clean and user-friendly UI.

## ⚛️ React Projects

- **🛒 [Shopping Cart App (React + Vite)](https://github.com/rakshasubramanya08/Shopping-cart-app)**  
  Developed a modular shopping cart UI referencing open-source projects; showcases frontend proficiency with real-time search, cart logic, and component-based architecture.

- **🎨 [Paint App (React + HTML5 Canvas)](https://github.com/rakshasubramanya08/Paint_App)**  
  Built a browser-based drawing tool using React, Vite, and HTML5 Canvas. Implemented interactive features like color selection, real-time drawing, and canvas clearing. Showcases event handling, state management, and modern UI design.

- **📷 [QR Code Generator App (React + Vite)](https://github.com/rakshasubramanya08/qrcode_gen)**

## 📌 Purpose

These projects are part of my hands-on learning experience to strengthen frontend development skills. They demonstrate core concepts such as:

- DOM manipulation and vanilla JavaScript interactivity  
- React component architecture and hooks  
- HTML5 Canvas and media APIs  
- UI/UX responsiveness and real-time updates  
- Clean code, modularity, and reusability
