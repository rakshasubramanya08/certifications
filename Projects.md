# Javascript projects:

- **🎬 [Custom Video Player(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)](https://github.com/rakshasubramanya08/video_play)**
 Built a fully functional and responsive video player with custom controls like play/pause, volume, seek bar, and skip functions. Designed to replicate real-world media player behavior using native browser APIs and DOM manipulation, with a clean and user-friendly UI. This project highlights my skills in interactive UI design and JavaScript event handling.
